Our project focuses on fraudulent financial transactions in day-to-day life using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to develop robust methods and machine learning models that can accurately classify financial transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on analysis of transaction data and relevant features. Effective fraud detection has critical applications in domains like banking, payments, and insurance, where it can help prevent substantial financial losses and maintain trust in these systems.
Through this project, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts in improving privacy and integrity within financial systems by effectively identifying and mitigating fraudulent transactions. Early detection of fraud enables timely intervention and mitigation of potential damages, enhancing the overall security and stability of financial operations.
